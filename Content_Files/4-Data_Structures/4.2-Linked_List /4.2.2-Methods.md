# Methods 

The methods in the linked_list will depend on your implementation and on the problems that you want to solve with the linked list. These are some of the most common methods of the linked list. 

## empty():

This returns whether the linked list is empty. Usually, the linked list has a member variable that keeps track of how many objects the data structure is storing. We will call this variable 'numOfElements'. Thanks to this variable, the empty() function knows if the stack is empty by checking if the value stored in  'elements' is equal to 0. 

Regardless of the elements in the linked list, the empty function takes the same time to return its result. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

## size(): 

This returns the number of elements in the linked list. Like the empty function, size uses the variable that stores the number of elements in the data structure and returns it. We are calling this variable 'numOfElements'. 

Regardless of the elements in the linked list, the size function takes the same time to return its result. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

## push_back(newElement):

Basically, this function takes the new element and stores that element as the value of a new node. In most cases, the linked list has a variable with the address of the last node, usually called the tail. After creating this new node, this function finds the tail and makes the last node's next variable point to this new node and the new node's parent variable point to the last node. Then the new node's next variable will point to None and become the new tail. 

Regardless of the elements in the linked list, the push_back function takes the same time to perform this operation. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

## push_front(newElement):

like the push back method, this function takes the new element and stores that element as the value of a new node. Usually, the linked list has a variable with the address of the first node, usually called head. After creating this new node, this function finds the head and makes the first node's parent variable point to this new node and the new node's next variable point to the first node. Then the new node's parent variable will point to None and become the new head. 

Regardless of the elements in the linked list, the push_front function takes the same time to perform this operation. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

## pop_back():
What this method does is simply unlink the last node from the linked list. In Python, a variable is deleted from memory when there are no more references to that memory address. The first thing that this function does is to find the parent node of the current tail. Then this function sets the parent's next variable to none and sets the parent node as the new tail. Note that the only two references of the previous last node are gone, so Python removes clears the memory allocated for that node.  

Regardless of the elements in the linked list, the pop_back function takes the same time to perform this operation. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

## pop_front():
What this method does is simply unlink the first node from the linked list. The first thing that this function does is to find the next node of the current head. Then this function sets the next node's parent variable to none and sets the next node as the new head. 

Regardless of the elements in the linked list, the pop_front function takes the same time to perform this operation. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

## remove(node):
This node takes a node and unlinks it from the linked list. First, this function finds the parent node and sets its next variable to point to the next node of the node to be deleted. then this function looks at the next node of the node to be deleted and points its parent variable to the parent node of the node to be deleted. Thus all references of the node are gone, the memory of the node is removed, and the chain of the linked list stays connected. 

Regardless of the elements in the linked list, the remove(node) function takes the same time to perform this operation. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

# Other methods

It is also common to see the following methods in a linked list. 

## Clear()
Basically, this method sound set head and tail to None. Since all references of the head and tail node will be gone, the memory of that node will be cleared as well as the nodes that they are pointing to. 

Regardless of the elements in the linked list, the clear function takes the same time to perform this function. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)


## Find(element)
This function loops through the entire linked list until it finds a node that has a value that matches the provided value. Then the function returns the address of the node that contains the element with the same value. This method is expensive. In the works scenario, the function will have to loop through the entire linked list without finding a match. 

Because the efficiency of this function is directly related to the number of elements in the linked list the time complexity of this function is 0(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the time that it takes to find an element depends on the number of elements. In the worst scenario where the element is not in the linked list, it will take n times to return a result
