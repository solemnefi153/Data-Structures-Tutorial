# Introduction

A linked list is a node-based data structure that solves some important issues that the classic List class (Array) has. 

Every time you try to insert a new value or element in the list that is full, a bigger chunk of memory is requested and all the values are copied over before you are even able to insert the new value to the end. The reason for that is because the slots of memory where you can insert data in a List should be located next to each other. This is a very expensive task in terms of time complexity. 

Now, imagine requesting a ton of memory to insert only one value and never using that extra memory. That also results in a waste of memory allocation. 

Likewise, if you wanted to delete an element in the middle or at the beginning of the List, you would have to move all adjacent elements on the slot to the left to cover the empty space. Also a very expensive operation. 

The way a linked list solves these issues is by simply using nodes, to be able to store data in memory without having to be adjacent. 

Nodes can help us keep track of a value, the address of the next, and sometimes the previous node in the list. Nodes can be allocated anywhere in memory, and organize data by storing addresses of the next and previous node. 


So basically, a linked list is an Array-based list implemented with nodes.
