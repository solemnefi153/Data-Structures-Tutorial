# Methods 

## empty():

This returns whether or not the stack is empty. Usually, the stack has a member variable that keeps track of how many objects the stack is storing. We will call this variable 'numOfElements'. Thanks to this variable, the empty() function knows if the stack is empty if the value stored in  'elements' is equal to 0. 

Regardless of the elements in the stack, the empty function takes the same time to return its result. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

## size(): 

This returns the number of elements in the stack. Like the empty function, size uses the variable that stores the number of elements in the stack and returns it. We are calling this variable 'numOfElements'. 

Regardless of the elements in the stack, the size function takes the same time to return its result. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)


## top():

This returns the element that is stored at the top of the stack.  Usually, an implementation of the stack would have a way to track the address or the index of the last element in the stack. This tracking system helps the speed of this function because, instead of looping to the whole stack to find the end of the top, the tracking system grabs the address or the index of the last element and returns the information stored in that location. 

Regardless of the elements in the stack, the top() function takes the same time to return its result. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

## push(newElement):

This method adds an element to the end of the stack. Usually, an implementation of the stack would have a way to track the last element that was added. 

If the implementation of the stack is using nodes, the push() method will create a new node and make the last element point to the new node. Then the new node will become the new top of the stack. 

If the implementation of the stack is using a list, this method will check if there is still more memory allocated for this data structure after the last element that was added. If there is, the element will simply be added next to the last element in memory. If not, a bigger chunk of memory will be allocated for this data structure, the values of the original list will be moved to the new chunk of memory and the original list will be deleted. Finally, the new element will be allocated next to the last element. The case when the memory needs to be relocated is rare. On average, inserting in a stack that is implemented with a list, takes the same time every time regardless of the elements in the stack. 


Whether the stack is implemented with a list of nodes, the top() function takes the same time to return its result. This is translated in the time complexity of O(1).

## pop(): 

This deletes the top element in the stack. 

If the stack was implemented with nodes, this function unlinks the last node from the linked list that creates the stack. Then the new top will be the node that was prior to the last node. 

On the other hand, if the stack was implemented with a list, the tracking method will just point to the index that corresponds to the previous element from last. 

Whether the stack is implemented with a list of nodes, the top() function takes the same time to return its result. This is translated in the time complexity of O(1).
