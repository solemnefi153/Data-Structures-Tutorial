# Introduction

A stack data structure that is designed to solve problems that require LIFO logic. 
LIFO stands for last in first out. What that means is that the last element to be inserted in the data structure is the first element to be removed. 

The stack is one of the most common data structures that we see in our everyday lives. For example, a stack of plates is a physical everyday life structure that is similar to a stack data structure. The last plate that is placed on top of the stack will be the first plate to be used. (Assuming that you will not grab a plate from the middle or the bottom of the stack.)
