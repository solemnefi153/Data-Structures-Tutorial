# Introduction

A tree is a node-based data structure. The nodes in this data structure have a value, a parent, a left child, and a right child. This data structure is ideal for problems where an element can have a parent and two children. For example, a family tree can be implemented in a tree data structure. The youngest person in the family would be the root node, and the left and right children of the node would be the parents of the person. As you progress in the tree the same pattern repeats in the next level of ancestry thus creating the following structure:

One of the main problems that the tree data structures solve is the time complexity of inserting in a sorted list and searching in a linked list.

When searching in a sorted list, the time complexity would result in O(log n). The reason for that is because the binary search splits the structure into halves until it finds the element or visits the last one. This means that even in the worst-case scenario the algorithm would not even visit half of the structure. That is very efficient, however, when inserting a new element, it would be necessary to shift all the elements to the right to make space for the new element in the list, resulting in the time complexity of O(n). 

On the other hand, inserting in a linked list is a very easy and efficient process that has a time complexity of O(1). However to find the right spot to keep the sorting order would take O(n) where n represents the number of elements that the algorithm would have to traverse to complete the function. Searching would also have a time complexity of O(n). Since there is no way to do a binary search on a linked list the algorithm would have to traverse every single one of the nodes until it finds a match or reaches the end of the linked list. 

The way a tree can solve these problems is by implementing something called a binary search tree, aka BST. A binary search tree organizes nodes in a way that all the left nodes of a parent node are less than the value of the node, and all the nodes to the right are equal or greater than the value of the node. In this structure, we can perform binary searches by having our algorithm check if the value of the currently visited node is less/equal or greater than the value that is being searched. In every iteration of the algorithm, half of the remaining nodes are discarded, obtaining a time complexity of O(log n)

Because this structure uses nodes, inserting values in this structure requires O(1) plus the time that it takes to find the right place O(log n). Resulting in overall time complexity of O(log n)
