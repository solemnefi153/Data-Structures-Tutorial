# Methods 

In this section, I am going to focus on the methods used to implement BST. The following are the most common methods of the BST. 

## empty():

This returns whether the binary search tree is empty. Usually, the BST has a  member variable that keeps track of how many objects the data structure is storing. We will call this variable 'numOfElements'. Thanks to this variable, the empty() function knows if the stack is empty by checking if the value stored in  'elements' is equal to 0. 

Regardless of the elements in the BST, the empty function takes the same time to return its result. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

## size(): 

This returns the number of elements in the BST. Like the empty function, size uses the variable that stores the number of elements in the data structure and returns it. We are calling this variable 'numOfElements'. 

Regardless of the elements in the BST, the size function takes the same time to return its result. This is translated in time complexity of O(1)

## insert(newElement):

The insert function performs a binary search until it finds a place where the new node can be placed. In every iteration, it checks if the currently visited node is less/equal or less than the value of the new node. If the value is less/equal, the new visited node will be the right child of the currently visited node. Otherwise, the new visited node will the left child of the currently visited node. If the iteration reaches a None value, that means that the algorithm has found the perfect spot for the new node and it will proceed by pointing the respective variable of the parent node to point to its new child node. Likewise, the new node will be pointing to its new parent. 

Inserting a node requires O(1), however, since it is necessary a binary search to find the perfect spot for the new node, the overall time complexity of this function ends up as O(log n)

## find(element):

The found element uses a binary search to check if the element exists on the data structure. It would start from the root and compare the searched element with the current visited node's value. If the current visited node value is less/equal than the searched value, then the new searched node would be the right child of the currently searched node. If the value is less than the value of the currently searched node, then the new searched value would be the left node of the currently searched node. 

If the algorithm reached a None, that means that the element is not located in the BST

Since find requires a binary search, the time complexity of this function is O(log n)

## deleteNode(node):
This method unlinks a node from a BST. For this operation, it is only necessary to arrange the pointers of the nodes to unlink the desired node. Because of that, the time complexity of this function is O(1), No matter how big the data structure is, the time would always be the same when deleting an element from a BST.
