# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to this Data Structures Tutorial. This course is intended to help python programmers understand the advantages, use, and performance of data structures. This course is divided into these main modules.  

- [Fundamentals](1-Fundamentals/1/Introduction.md)
<!-- - [Array Based Data Structures](2-Array_Based_Data_Structures/Introduction.md)
- [Node Based Data Structures](3-Node_Based_Data_Structures/Introduction.md) -->
- [Data Sctuctures](./4-Data_Structures/4.1-Stack/4.1.1-Introduction.md)


The "Fundamentals" module, will walk you through the main topics that you need to know to better understand data structures. This information with help you  better decide which data structures to use in your own code. 

The other two modules are divided in submodules. Every submodule will go over one different kind of data structure.  
Each submodule will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module or submodule, you will find a problem to solve on your own.
