# What are data structures? 

Data structures are classes that allaw programers to manipulate data and utilize computer memory in an efficient way. These data structures have methods and member variables like any other class. Each data structure is different and has different methods, efficiency and use. 

To understand data structures and why they are important, think about data types like CHAR. You can create an instance of a CHAR to store character in memory. But if you wanted to store a complete sentence, you would have to create an instance of a CHAR for every character in the sentence. Now, what would happen if you needed to delete or add more words to your sentence? You would end up with unused memory or not enough space from your initial CHARs.
