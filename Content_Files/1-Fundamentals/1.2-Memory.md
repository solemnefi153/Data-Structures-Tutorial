# Memory 

To understand memory in the context of data structures, it is important to distinguish some differences between the storage memory and the temporary memory or random access memory (RAM) that our computers have. When you save a file on your computer the file's data is stored on the storage memory. The storage memory is a permanent memory that regardless of whether the computer has power or not, the memory is preserved. In other words, there is no need for electricity to keep the memory in the storage. That is awesome!

Now the problem with storage memory is that it takes too long to read and write data to the storage memory. If you were playing a video game that used the storage memory to update the position of a player, you would notice that your game would run really slow. Because of that problem, there is another type of memory that is faster to read and write to. This kind of memory is the random access memory of your computer. All your computer program files are stored in the storage memory, but when you turn your computer on and open your programs, an instance of those program files starts to run on the RAM. 

Sometimes, when you close your programs, you get a prompt to save your changes before closing the program. The reason for that is because when you close your programs, the memory allocated in the RAM for that program is cleared. So unless you save your changes on the storage memory, the new state of the program or the changes on the files will be lost. 

Let's illustrate the RAM with the following grid: 
![Ram grid illustration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solemnefi153/Data-Structures-Tutorial/master/Resources/Picture_Files/ram_grid.png)

Every square in the grid represents a memory slot. A memory slot is a space in memory where a binary value (0 / 1) called bit can be stored. Data types require multiple memory slots to store their values. For example, an integer requires  16 memory slots orbits to store one number. The number 1s would look like this in memory = 0000 0000 0000 0001

When in your program you instantiate a variable, the computer searches for empty memory slots where the variable can fit in the memory RAM. 

The more filled the Memory RAM is, the longest it takes to find an empty space to allocate the necessary memory for your programs. Because of that reason, people like to get Memory RAMs with bigger capacities, so that they can run multiple programs without slowing down their computers. 

Now that you understand a little better how memory works, I hope you can appreciate the work of data structures and the importance of picking the right data structure to avoid waste of memory.
